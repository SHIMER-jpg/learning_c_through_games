/*
The Game of Eight

------------------

The game of 8 is played by 2 players

The game starts with the initial number 8 (from here on refered to as the initial number)
The first player will choose a number from 1 to 3 (from here on refered to as the chosen number)
If the player inputs something outside of the 1 to 3 range it should be an error and the player must choose again
The initial number is subtracted by the chosen number
Then the next player's turn happens
The next player cannot choose the number that the last player chose
If the initial number goes to 0 on your turn, then you win
Otherwise if the number goes below 0, your opponent wins
The player should always see what choices are available to him when prompted to enter his choice
After the game is over, the user should be prompted whether they want to play again
