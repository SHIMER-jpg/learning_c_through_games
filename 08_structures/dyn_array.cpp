// Problem: Improve your Dynamic array that you made previously by using structs to hold the pointer to the dynamic array and the size and capacity of the array:

// struct DynamicArray{
//    int * dynamicArray;
//    int capacity;
//    int size;
// };

// update all the functions to reflect this change. 

// What's a way you could use to change the type of data being held in the dynamic array?
