Problem: Write a program that will keep a list of contacts. The contact will have a name (first name and last name), and a phone number (no dashes). The program will read in all the saved contacts at the start of program. The user will be able to either look at all their contacts or add a new contact or quit the app. Once the contact is added it should be saved. The names should be no more than 256 characters.
